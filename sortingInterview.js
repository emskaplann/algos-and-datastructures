// Mainly used sorting algos: Quick, Merge and Insertion

// Radix & Counting Sort are used when the data has a range and doesn't have decimal values like 1.32 which means all the data in the set should be integer.

// You need to consider Worst Case(O(n^2)) when using Quick Sort, It's not like Merge in that way also, picking up the pivot point is important in Quick Sort.

// Insertion is used when the data is small or pre sorted.

// Merge is the best algo in most cases. O(n log n) in all cases.
